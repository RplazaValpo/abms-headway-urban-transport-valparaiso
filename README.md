# ABMS Headway Urban Transport – Valparaíso

This repository contains an Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) framework for the analysis of headway regularity in urban collective transport systems. The case study focuses on the Cerro Barón – Bellavista corridor in Valparaíso, Chile.

## Objectives
- Model the dynamics of collective taxis using an agent-based approach.
- Analyze headway variability under different congestion levels and time-of-day regimes.
- Estimate statistical indicators of regularity using Monte Carlo replication.
- Provide a foundation for future bio-inspired optimization of transport operations.

## Methods
- Agent-Based Modeling (ABMS)
- Discrete-time simulation
- Headway metrics (mean, variance, coefficient of variation)
- Monte Carlo replication
- Congestion through local interaction rules

## Technologies
- Python
- Mesa (ABMS framework)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Project Status
Research-oriented simulation model developed as part of a doctoral-level course in Applied Computer Engineering.
